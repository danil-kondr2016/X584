# X584

X584 is a graphical simulator of a microcomputer system based on Soviet-era [K584VM1](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F#%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_584) 4-bit slice microprocessor (a clone of [Texas Instruments SBP0400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SBP0400)). The application was developed in 2005-2006 using C++ Builder 6. The user interface and code comments are in Russian only.
